            <p id="introText" class="text" style="margin-top:75px;">I'm an aspiring programmer, who creates and tests game mechanics - alongside other things, that spark my interest. I work to make these mechanics feel as smooth and user friendly as possible, while still having the depth of technicality that make them enjoyable to play.</p>
            <p id="interestsText" class="text" style="margin-top:20px;">I use the Unity engine in order to make such projects, and although all my project may not yet be finished, I still takeaway at least one new skill from each one. Whether that be a networking trick or a certain interactions method.</p>

                <p class="displayText">This is a simple 2D shooter game. This project taught me that you need to sync pretty much everything up, and they all have their own seperate ways of getting synced. The process was probably the longest I've ever been through, but the end result works perfectly.'</p>
