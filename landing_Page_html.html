            <p id="introText" class="videoText">My name is Ben Feltham. I'm an aspiring programmer, who creates and tests game mechanics - along with other things - that have spark my interest. I work to make these mechanics feel as smooth and user friendly as possible, while still having the depth of technicality that make them enjoyable to play.</p>
            <p id="interestsText" class="videoText">I use the Unity engine in order to make such projects, and although every project might not get finished, I still takeaway at least one new skill from each one. Whether that be a networking trick or a certain interactions method.</p>
